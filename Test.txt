🚀 Big Win for CloudBranch! 🎉

Team,
We were facing a critical issue where all Microfrontend code was being loaded eagerly, even when not in view. This led to unnecessary payload and performance degradation.

I’m happy to share that we’ve successfully implemented lazy loading of Microfrontends, ensuring code is only loaded when actually needed. This has significantly optimized performance, saving ~600KB per Microfrontend 🎯

This is a huge win for the CloudBranch project — not just for faster load times, but also for a smoother user experience and more efficient resource utilization.

Great work and let’s keep the momentum going! 💪🔥
