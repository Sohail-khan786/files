ðŸš€ Big Win for CloudBranch! ðŸŽ‰

Team,
We were facing a critical issue where all Microfrontend code was being loaded eagerly, even when not in view. This led to unnecessary payload and performance degradation.

Iâ€™m happy to share that weâ€™ve successfully implemented lazy loading of Microfrontends, ensuring code is only loaded when actually needed. This has significantly optimized performance, saving ~600KB per Microfrontend ðŸŽ¯

This is a huge win for the CloudBranch project â€” not just for faster load times, but also for a smoother user experience and more efficient resource utilization.

Great work and letâ€™s keep the momentum going! ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥
